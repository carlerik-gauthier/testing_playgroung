# Testing Playgroung

# Objective

The purpose of this repo is to experiment testing with an ML project. 
I'll be using **pytest**.

# Data and Model

For this project, the Titanic dataset is used.

The model is going to be a random forest. Note that no optimization is perform, nor advanced feature engineering.

A useful tip when figuring out what's going wrong is to have some .py file to experiment. Of course, this file should 
not be Git-ed

It's useful for 2 reasons :
    - correcting the tested function or extend its ability to handle unexpected cases
    - correcting the test itself. After all, it is code :) . It might as well be a coding issue as a logical one
