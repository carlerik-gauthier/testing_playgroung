# Testing Playgroung

# Objective

The purpose of this repo is to experiment unit testing with an ML project. Not only does it cover the expected behavior 
from a function, but is also test whether data is correctly transformed or not.  
I'll be using **pytest**.

# Data and Model

In this project, the Titanic dataset is used.

The model is going to be a random forest. Note that neither optimization nor advanced feature engineering is performed.

# Helpful tip 
A useful tip when figuring out what's going wrong is to have some .py file to experiment. Of course, this file should 
not be Git-ed

It's useful for 2 reasons :
    - correcting the tested function or extend its ability to handle unexpected cases
    - correcting the test itself. After all, it is code :) . It might as well be a coding issue as a logical one 

# Conclusion
Writing test about data transformation is interesting since it forces to think thoroughly about how it is transformed
within a given function. As such, a first consequence of this project is that I started to think about lots of weird 
cases that may happen. As such, it allowed me to redesign some functions to handle situations I haven't thought when 
writing them in the first-hand.

Another lesson learnt thanks to this project is that data transformation should be carried by a multitude of function 
having one task rather than 1 or 2 functions doing all the job ... it is easier to test and to understand the process.
